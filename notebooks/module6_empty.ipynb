    "One of the most effective, and simple, methodologies for hardening deep learning models against adversarial attacks is simply \"showing\" them what they are.  A process known as adversarial training.\n",

    "Here, we recreate the adversarial training from [Kurakin et al.] that uses the FGSM attack from [Goodfellow et al.] to augment the training examples with adversarial examples.  Note that this coupling of adversarial attack and training was found, in the context of computer vision, to produce robustness which was misleading because it was actually learning to obfuscate the gradient used as a \"signal\" to create the adversarial example and not necessarily becoming robust to the attack [Tramer et al.].  The adversarial training methodology was then extended to Ensemble Adversarial Training by [Tramer et al.], however, this notebook only demonstrates the adversarial training proposed in [Kurakin et al.] as it can be more easily self-contained into a notebook for demonstration.\n",
